- DBAPI::escape() adjustment (again) to avoid certain issues when using native PDO along-side legacy manager code calling the mysql extension.
- Removed & from getMany call in modCacheManager to prevent PHP warnings in PHP 4.
- [xPDO] Added additional logic to xPDO::loadClass() which will return an error immediately if no class name is provided.
- Adjusted modDocument::getMany() signature; added $cacheFlag= false parameter.
- Remerged mutate_content.dynamic.php to fix several problems saving documents.
- Adjusted queries in refresh_site.dynamic.php.
- Added session table to install script due to failure of auto-table creation on some environments.
- Removed unnecessary if statement around session_set_save_handler() in modX::_initSession(); the actual problem was auto-table creation was failing.
- Fix DBAPI::escape() function; PDO::quote() adds single-quotes unlike the legacy mysql escape functions and this was causing content truncation.
- [xPDO] xPDOCacheHandler class updated to allow configuration properties to determine a class for handling xPDO object and result set caching.
- modX::_initSession() updated to better handle situations where session_set_save_handler() fails when trying to override default PHP session handling.
- [xPDO] Modified fromArray() so it is not responsible for determining the _new attribute of xPDOObject instances.  This is the responsibility of xPDO::getObject(), which uses xPDO::load(), and xPDO::getCollection().
- Fix datasetpager error with PDO changes so DocManager module can load.
- Fix WebUser login -- weblogin.processor.inc.php.
- Fix makeUrl() -- no longer needs to add base_url.
- Fix upgrade install script to insert new config settings properly.
- Few tweaks to modX::_initSession function (was setting session_name twice).
- Changed all line-endings to unix-style \n on all files.
- Removed assets/cache/* which is replaced by core/cache/*.
- Updated version data format to be compatible with PHP's version_compare() function.
- Resolved problems setting primary keys values and improperly identifying new objects when using xPDOObject::fromArray().
- Several adjustments to xPDO::load(), xPDO::getCollection() and several xPDOObject methods based on changes to xPDOObject::fromArray().
- Added stripslashes() to modRequest::_sanitize() when working with magic_quotes_gpc enabled.
- Fix to MakeTable::prepareOrderByLink() to handle FURLs properly.
- Reduce exposure of critical database credentials in xPDO::load() when errors are reported/logged.
- Fixed error in xPDOObject::save(); updates to objects with compound primary keys were failing.
- Added proper escapes to deprecated modX::getFullTableName() to fix issues when dashes (-) or other reserved (My)SQL characters appear in a database name.
- Merged with trunk (0.9.5 final) at revision 2106.
- Removed session_keepalive code.
- Merged with trunk (0.9.5) at revision 2066.
- Merged with trunk (0.9.5) at revision 2063.
- Schema updates based on column size changes in 0.9.5.
- Added missing modX::getSettings() method.
- Various bug fixes.
- Merged with trunk (0.9.5) at revision 1945.
- [bug fix] Fixed a modParser bug when CDATA wrappers were encountered.
- Add missing webAlert function to new modX class.
- Modify categories save process to get the insert id using $modx->lastInsertId().
- Fix to setup.sql; changed ENGINE= to TYPE= when creating new context table to avoid problems with MySQL versions before 4.1.
- Fixed invalid reference to mergeDocumentMETATags in modResponse class.
- [New feature] Allow custom error handler classes.
- [New feature] Fine-grained configuration options for caching pages, database results, or disabling the cache altogether (see system settings starting with `cache.`).  Turn the different caching options on/off or set a default time-to-live for those items being cached.
- [New feature] Database result-set and xPDO object caching, with support for memcache, native-JSON object caching for high-performance AJAX requests.
- [New feature] Configurable session management with default implementation configured for modSessionHandler, an xPDO-based implementation that stores sessions in a database, and allows a great deal of configurability, by site and/or context.
- [New feature] Contexts allows a site to be organized into sub-sites, subdomains, etc, and override any system settings by context.  The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.
- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.
