Wayfinder Snippet to build site navigation menus
 
Totally refactored from original DropMenu nav builder to make it easier to
create custom navigation by using chunks as output templates. By using templates,
many of the paramaters are no longer needed for flexible output including tables,
unordered- or ordered-lists (ULs or OLs), definition lists (DLs) or in any other
format you desire.

Example: [[Wayfinder? &startId=`0`]]
